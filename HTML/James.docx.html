    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">1:1 JAMES INTRODUCES HIMSELF</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;In his letter to the churches, James
            identifies himself as a servant of Christ sent to the Jews of the Diaspora. In the early church it was
            customary to assume that New Testament books had been written by apostles or under the close supervision of
            an apostle, and two of the original twelve were called James. One of these was the brother of John and son
            of Zebedee, and the other was the son of Alphaeus. The first of these was the associate of Peter and John
            and became the first head of the church at Jerusalem, where he was martyred about a.d. 44. The second
            disappeared from view after the resurrection of Jesus. Some of the Fathers assumed that one of these two
            wrote this letter, though they were not sure which one. Most Fathers, though, concluded that it was another
            James, the one who appears in the New Testament among the brothers of Jesus. This James was head of the
            Jerusalem church from a.d. 44 to 62 and is a much more plausible candidate for authorship than either of the
            others. The assumption then was that this James, whose authority derived from his close kinship with Jesus,
            was writing from the Jewish capital to those Jews who had left Palestine and were scattered across the Roman
            world. The fact that he refers to himself as a &ldquo;servant&rdquo; was regarded as a sign of his humility
            and as standing in sharp contrast to the usual letter-writing practice of the time. Today the authenticity
            of James is still questioned, but most scholars recognize that it must be one of the earliest New Testament
            writings. The authorship of James the brother of Jesus continues to find its defenders and must be regarded
            as plausible, even if it cannot be proved now any more than it could be in patristic times. To be a slave of
            Christ is, for the apostles, greater than having command of all the kingdoms of the world (Didymus,
            Oecumenius). This is a voluntary servanthood (Hilary of Arles). James wrote this letter to those suffering
            persecution (Bede).</span></p>

            Judea as procurator when he was informed of the death of Festus. But the younger Annas, who as I said had
            received the high priesthood, was headstrong in character and audacious in the extreme. He belonged to the
            sect of the Sadducees, who in judging offenders are cruel beyond any of the Jews, as I have already made
            clear. Being a man of this kind, Annas thought that he had a convenient opportunity, as Festus was dead and
            Albinus still on the way. So he assembled a council of judges and brought it before James, the brother of
            Jesus, known as Christ, and several others. Annas charged them with breaking the law and handed them over to
            be stoned. But those who were considered the most fair-minded people in the city, and strict in their
            observance of the law, were most indignant at this, and sent secretly to the king, imploring him to write to
            Annas to stop behaving in this way. His conduct had been wrong from the first. Some of them too waylaid
            Albinus on the road from Alexandria and explained that it was illegal for Annas to assemble a council
            without his authority. Convinced by their arguments, Albinus wrote an angry letter to Annas, threatening to
            punish him. In consequence, King Agrippa deprived him of the high priesthood, which he had held for three
            months only, and appointed Jeshua son of Dammaeus. Jewish Antiquities 20.9.1.</span><span

            to reveal himself to James after his passion, and eventually it became proverbial to say: &ldquo;He appeared
            also to James.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;James refers to himself as a
            servant, but we must remember that there are two kinds of servitude, voluntary and involuntary. The
            involuntary servant is a slave who fears punishment, and therefore his service does not spring from love.
            But the voluntary servant is really no different from a son. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To the Persecuted.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: We read that when Stephen was
            martyred a great persecution of the church broke out at Jerusalem and that they were all scattered across
            the countryside of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles. James then wrote this letter to those who had
            been scattered because they had suffered persecution for the sake of righteousness. And not only to them,
            but also, as the rest of the letter testifies, to those who had become Christians but who were still
            struggling to achieve perfection, as well as to those who remained outside the faith themselves and did
            their best to persecute and disturb believers. All of these people were exiles, though for different
            reasons. But we also read in the Acts of the Apostles that at the time of our Lord's death there were devout
            Jews &ldquo;from every nation under heaven.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">5</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;What these nations were is explained a little further on, where Luke mentions Parthians,
            Medes, Elamites, inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and so on.</span><span class="c0 c4">6</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;James also exhorts the righteous not to lose their faith, and he rebukes sinners, warning
            them that they must refrain from sinning and practice virtue, so that they would not be condemned by those
            who had received the sacraments of faith in an unfruitful way, even worthy of hell. He goes now to warn
            unbelievers to repent of the murder of the Savior and of the other crimes in which they were implicated
            before divine retribution overtook them secretly, or even openly for that matter. Concerning the Epistle of

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Slaves of Christ.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: More than any worldly
            dignity, the Lord's apostles gloried in the fact that they were slaves of Christ. That is how they wanted to

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To the Twelve Tribes in Dispersion.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Isho'dad of Merv:
            The opening resembles the titles of St. Paul's letters, and perhaps James is the author of it, whoever he
            may be. He was unacquainted with Paul's custom of writing to one particular nation and city, and for a
            particular reason. Instead, this author writes to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations because of
            the captivity, and not to the churches in every place, because he had no particular reason to be so
            specific. Commentaries, Prologue.</span><span class="c0 c4">9</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">1:2&ndash;15 TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;James was writing to people who were suffering
            from temptations of various kinds, though there is no sign that a general persecution of Christians had as
            yet broken out. The Greek word </span><span class="c0 c3">peirasmos</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can be
            translated either as &ldquo;trial&rdquo; or as &ldquo;temptation,&rdquo; and the second of these
            possibilities dominated the Fathers' interpretation of these verses. To them the cure for temptation was
            patient endurance, which was the fruit of a spiritual wisdom that could be obtained only from God. There was
            no problem with obtaining this, as long as believers asked God for wisdom in faith, without doubting that
            they would receive it. Doubt and riches appear as the greatest enemies of true faith because in their
            different ways, they both contributed to human pride and arrogance. Once those vices took control, it was
            impossible to wage war against temptation, because temptation was also the fruit of human lusts and
            therefore a close ally of pride. It was essential therefore to overcome this basic human weakness, since
            failure to do so would lead inevitably to spiritual death.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Prepare for many temptations (Chryosostom, Hilary of Arles). They will be like a
            raging torrent that only a strong swimmer can negotiate (Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine). The joy of faith is
            proved through endurance (Oecumenius, Symeon). No one can take away this joy (Bede). We are tempted by
            adversities in order to learn the virtue of patience (Bede) and faith (Hilary of Arles). We are not to be
            discouraged by these trials (Andreas). The purity of faith is made perfect by patient endurance of
            affliction (Bede, Andreas, Oecumenius), which casts out fear (Hilary of Arles).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We pray that the faith that justifies may increase in those who already have it and
            also that it may be given to those who have not yet received it (Augustine). We must ask God for the
            spiritual wisdom to face temptations (Bede, Oecumenius, Theophylact), a wisdom that only God can give
            (Augustine, Hilary of Arles, Bede). One who does not ask in faith is not heard (Hilary of Arles, Bede). The
            root of doubt is pride (Cyril of Alexandria), which easily turns into despair (Oecumenius). Ask without
            hesitation without being double-minded (Bede, Oecumenius). Do not worry inordinately about your guilt, but
            count on God's mercy (Hermas). A double-minded person is one who prays to God yet fails to obtain anything
            because one's conscience is still accusing all the time (Bede). Such a person is unstable (Origen), like
            waves on the sea (Oecumenius). Meanwhile every good thing comes to the humble (Hilary of Arles, Oecumenius,
            Theophylact).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Only those who endure adversity are rewarded (Bede). What puffs up the rich is what
            brings them down (Oecumenius). Their wealth is vulnerable (Hilary of Arles, Bede, Oecumenius). The heavier
            the endured sufferings of the righteous, the more courageous are their victories (Sulpicius Severus). A
            crown awaits them (Chrysostom, Bede). James encourages the hope that the present situation will be put
            aright (Didymus). Any testing that comes from God is for good, not for evil. Not so with the devil, who
            tempts in order to kill and who does not know us as God knows (Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine, Bede,
            Andreas). God may abandon us at times to reveal our own stubborn willing (Peter Chrysologus). To find a
            remedy our very nature must be healed (Augustine). Lust does not give birth unless it conceives, and it does
            not conceive unless it receives willing consent to commit evil (Augustine). Until we labor and give birth to
            our corrupt thoughts, we seem happy and joyful, but once the wicked child called sin is born we are in pain
            as we realize the shame to which we ourselves have given birth (Chrysostom). Lust coaxes and urges on,
            positively encouraging us to do something bad. If we ponder it willingly, then it will conceive and give
            birth (Augustine, Hesychius). Suggestion, experiment and consent are the three stages of temptation (Bede,
            Hilary).</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Count It Joy.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Origen: If you count it all joy when you

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Torrent of the Trial.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Cyril of Jerusalem:
            &ldquo;Falling into temptation&rdquo; may mean being overwhelmed by temptation, for temptation is like a
            raging torrent which engulfs the traveler. In times of temptation some people manage to cross this torrent
            without being overwhelmed by the rising tide, because they are good swimmers who can avoid being swept away.

            temptations. He says that if there are some among us who do not understand why it is that we need to be
            tested in this way, then we should ask God to explain to us that a father must punish his children in order
            to make them ready for the inheritance of eternal life. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ask God for Wisdom.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: James calls wisdom the
            cause of perfection. He knows that faith is tried and tested in affliction. There is no need to ask God for
            perfect people. What we need are wise people. This is why he encourages those who want to be on top of their

            whoever knows that he has not kept the Lord's commandments will quite rightly have no hope of being heard by
            him. As Scripture says: &ldquo;If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an

            him because of his pride, because he quickly despairs of ever getting something which he asks for if it does
            not turn up immediately. In any case, it is no bad thing if someone who thinks too highly of himself has his

            double-minded man is one who on the one hand prays to God and on the other hand fails to obtain anything
            from him because inside his conscience is accusing him all the time. A man is double-minded when he wants to
            have fun in this world but also reign with God in heaven. Likewise, a man is double-minded when he seeks the
            approval of others for his good deeds rather than spiritual rewards from God. Concerning the Epistle of St.

            the present but rather drifts about here and there, grasping at whatever he can. He may be compared with the

            which assault our souls and which are inspired by the devil. He wants to dispel the notion that the God who
            puts good thoughts into our minds also fills them with evil intentions. No one who has such wicked thoughts

            drunk with pleasure, we do not notice it. But when it gives birth and reaches its goal, then all the
            pleasure is extinguished and the bitter core of our mind comes to the surface. This stands in contrast to
            women in labor. For before they give birth, such women have great pain and suffering, but afterwards the
            pain goes away, leaving their bodies along with the child. But here it is quite different. For until we
            labor and give birth to our corrupt thoughts, we are happy and joyful. But once the wicked child called sin
            is born we are in pain as we realize the shame to which we have given birth, and then we are pierced through
            more deeply than any woman in labor. Therefore I beg you right from the start not to welcome any corrupt
            thought, for if we do so the seeds will grow inside us, and if we get to that stage, the sin inside us will
            come out in deeds and strike us dead by condemning us, in spite of all our confessions and tears. For there

            coddles you, it excites and urges you on, positively encouraging you to do something wrong. Do not give in

            devil's suggestions, then we have victory over temptation and deserve to inherit the crown of life. But if
            we let the enemy's suggestions gradually take control of us, then we find that we are taken away from the
            right path and start to indulge in sin. However, if we go no further than initial experiments, we may have
            offended God, but we have not yet fallen into mortal sin. However, if we continue down the path of depravity
            and start to embrace evildoing by giving our full consent to it, then we are deserving of death, and the

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Above all else, believers in Christ must be
            careful not to fall into the trap of deception in spiritual matters. Every spiritual gift comes from God and
            reflects his character as the Father of lights. Every good endowment is an undeserved, a free gift of God
            for which we pray every day (Augustine). What God gives is without defect (Didymus). The soul is
            progressively enlightened in its ascent after the resurrection (Origen), cleansed from wickedness
            (Oecumenius). The procession of Light spreads itself generously toward us in a unitive way
            (Pseudo-Dionysius). Nothing can add or subtract from God's glory (Novatian), who is unchanging in his divine
            essence (Severus). No shadow can cut off God's light (Gregory the Great). Anyone who stands in this light
            wishes to share it with others (Symeon). We must, however, distinguish our begottenness as children of light
            from the eternal begottenness of the Son (Andreas, Bede, Oecumenius).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Therefore, those who possess God's Spirit will be self-controlled in their behavior
            and will avoid every form of wickedness. Above all, truly spiritual persons will do their utmost to put
            their faith into practice, since that is the ultimate test of what it means to be born again in Christ. The
            truth heard is less prone to corruption than the truth spoken (Augustine). The tongue must be disciplined
            (Bede). To be quick to hear implies eagerness to put into practice what has been heard (Oecumenius). Two
            things in particular are indicative of spiritual maturity: the ability to hold one's tongue and a
            willingness to be generous toward those who are in need. A charitable disposition and charitable behavior
            must go hand in hand in the life of someone who wants to imitate God's perfect charity. Widows and orphans
            are especially to be looked after (Hermas, Hilary of Arles). We become more like God in showing acts of
            mercy (Chrysostom). Illusions about one's own correctness arise out of the lack of self-control (Gregory the
            Great, Oecumenius). Imitate God's justice, which is without anger (Bede). Avoid uncontrollable fury, which
            leads to a habituation to wickedness (Andreas, Bede, Oecumenius). One single uniting Word is addressed to us
            through many scriptures (Augustine). We are called to enact in behavior what we hear (Augustine,
            Oecumenius). We best view our deeper selves in the mirror of the gospel (Hilary of Arles). Yet if we behold
            ourselves in this mirror and then forget it or fail to confirm it in deeds, what we have learned will slip
            out of our hands (Andreas, Oecumenius). The doer of the Word delights in the perfect law that liberates from
            sin and death (Augustine, Oecumenius).</span></p>

            determinateness&mdash;in good and in bad, in sadness and in joy, in death and in life. Because of this
            error, James goes on to add that it is &ldquo;every good endowment and every perfect gift&rdquo; which comes

            giver of these things, the divine gifts come to human beings. These gifts, James says, are the very best,
            complete and without defect, undoubtedly perfect. But as there are some people who argue from this that only
            the good things in life come from God, and not things which are regarded as bad or harmful, we have to
            recall such passages as &ldquo;he brought evil on them,&rdquo;</span><span class="c0 c4">3</span><span

            never changes or transforms himself into other forms, lest by changing he should somehow appear to be
            mortal. For the modification implied in change from one thing to another involves a share in death of some
            sort. Therefore there is never any addition of parts or of glory in him, lest anything should seem to have
            been wanting to the perfect one in the first place. Nor can there be any diminution in him, for that would

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">First Fruits.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas: The birth here applies in the
            first instance to the Son and then by extension to the creatures. For to him belong truth and
            consubstantiality with God, whereas to the creatures belong honor and inheritance. The fact that the same
            name is used does not mean that the same honor is given, nor should things which are said by extension be
            taken to mean that they apply in the first instance as well. By &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo; James means that
            we are the first and most highly honored. For by &ldquo;creatures&rdquo; he means the visible creation, of

            this way God has made us somehow a part of his own nature, James goes on to add that the result of the
            divine activity is that we have become &ldquo;the first fruits of his creatures,&rdquo; which means that we

            have been born it is clear that we have also been changed. How can something be immutable if it has gone
            from nonbeing to being? Furthermore he adds that God has given us birth by the Word of Life, lest we might
            be tempted to think that his Son was also born in the same way as we are. But according to John, all things
            were made by the Son, which means that he was not born along with us who have been made by him. Commentary

            say this, for it is stupid to think that someone who is not prepared to learn from others will somehow be
            well-equipped to preach to them. Someone who wants to become wise must first of all ask for this gift from
            God, as James has already said. Then he must find himself a good teacher and in the meantime discipline his
            tongue so that he says nothing useless but restricts himself to preaching the truth which he has recently

            says &ldquo;quick to hear&rdquo; he is not talking about simple listening but about eagerness to put into
            practice what has been heard. For he distinguishes quite clearly between the person who is ready to act on
            what he has heard and the one who is weighed down by laziness and procrastination, sometimes even to the

            it? Why does he not rebuke them and turn them away from it? To this we answer that James accommodates
            himself to them and starts where they are. Rather than attack the law head on, he draws them away from it
            gradually, aware that they are suspicious of new ideas and inclined toward skepticism about them. By doing

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Salvation in Christ breaks down all barriers
            between human beings. It is clear that for James some of the most intractable problems on this score were
            influenced by economic factors. Rich people in the church were expecting and receiving special
            considerations from their wealth. This was an insidious attack on the gospel, which especially honored one
            who was poor in worldly goods but rich in spiritual things. To show contempt for the poor is as much an
            infraction of the law as murder or adultery, and it is even more serious because it is so common. Christians
            must learn to fight against the temptations of worldly wealth and concentrate instead on the heavenly
            blessings, which are the only true riches. Both rich and poor are all of one body in Christ (Chrysostom).
            Ostentation and favoritism are reproached (Augustine, Hilary of Arles, Oecumenius). God chooses the weak to
            shame the strong (Augustine). The nobility are not immune from criticism (Salvian). The displaced poor are
            comforted by God (Hilary of Arles), and their energies are especially used of God (Oecumenius). Those who
            base their lives on greed are the poorest of all (Chrysostom). Loving the neighbor has a literal reference
            to those immediately present, a spiritual reference to those absent, and a contemplative reference to love
            itself (Hilary of Arles). Treat the neighbor as you would one most dear (Andreas). To have fallen from the
            precept of love is thereby to have offended in all the other commandments (Caesarius of Arles, Augustine,
            Andreas). God's righteousness is like a covering over the whole body, hiding all offenses (Gregory the
            Great). Adultery and murder are mentioned as extreme examples of offenses against love (Hilary of Arles,
            Oecumenius). There can be no favoritism in the law of liberty under which we are to be prepared to be judged
            (Oecumenius). Mercy breaks chains, dispels darkness, extinguishes fire, kills the worm and takes away the
            gnashing of teeth (Chrysostom). It is an oil of escape from the demonic (Hesychius). The mercy that one does
            not show to others will not be shown to him (Augustine, Braulio of Saragossa). We ask God to forgive us as
            we forgive others, but if we do not forgive, we shall not be forgiven (Oecumenius).</span></p>

            think highly of yourself, when someone else despises you? Are we not all one body, both great and small?
            Therefore if in principle we are all one and members of each other, why do you mindlessly exalt yourself?
            Why do you bring shame on your brother? For just as he is a part of you, so you too are a part of him.

            class="c0">&nbsp;Hilary of Arles: &ldquo;Love your neighbor&rdquo; means three different things. The first
            is corporal, that is, the literal sense of the words. The second is spiritual, according to which we love
            those close to us even though we may be absent from them. The third is contemplative, by which love itself
            is beheld. But we have to understand that one leads to another. The corporal inspires us to go on to the
            spiritual, and that in turn lifts us up to the contemplative. The spiritual may sometimes regress to the
            merely corporal, but the contemplative never fails us. The corporal and spiritual forms of love are common
            to human beings and have analogies in animals, but the contemplative is reserved for humans alone.

            righteous in some of the things he does and unrighteous in others, it is rather as if he is covering one

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The duty to help one's brothers and sisters in
            need is a paramount obligation of everyone who claims to have faith. Pious talk without equally serious
            deeds is not only useless but also wicked. Faith is shown through one's deeds (Andreas). Those who practice
            evil but think they have faith are confused (Augustine). Words alone do not help the hungry (Bede). Love
            cares about the body as well as the soul (Hilary of Arles, Valerian of Cimiez). Opportunities to care for
            the poor may pass quickly (Caesarius of Arles). Clemency will be exalted above condemnation for those who
            are merciful (Leo). Lacking works, faith is dead (Origen, Augustine, Leo). Works give life to faith (Hilary
            of Arles). They have faith who are willing to follow Christ in his suffering (Symeon). Words alone do not
            save (Chrysostom). Faith shows through deeds (Symeon). The devils in a sense believe that God exists (Bede)
            with trembling and wordy confessions that Christ is Son of God (Andreas, Caesarius) but not with active love
            (Augustine). Worse than the devils are those who presume to have faith but do not even tremble (Hilary of
            Arles). No one receives the gift of justification on the basis of merit derived from works performed
            beforehand (Bede). Active faith shines forth through works (Cyril of Alexandria, Salvian). It is foolish to
            presume to believe without acting (Oecumenius).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Fathers were well aware that Paul had spoken of salvation by faith without the
            works of the law, but they saw no contradiction between that and what James is saying here. The reason for
            this is that James and Paul are speaking in complementary ways. It is impossible to earn salvation by doing
            things to please God, and everyone must be clear that we can be saved only by faith. Both belief and action
            are intrinsic to faith (Augustine, Bede, Oecumenius). Both Paul and James knew that Abraham was perfect in
            his faith as well as in his works (Bede). James is talking here about faith after baptism, for a faith
            without works can only make us more guilty of sin, seeing that we have received a talent but are not using
            it profitably (Oecumenius). Prebaptismal faith does not of itself require works but only confession and the
            word of salvation, by which those who believe in Christ are justified. Postbaptismal faith is conjoined with
            works (Andreas). Isaac was an earthly type of Christ being offered up for us all (Hilary of Arles). When
            Abraham bound Isaac to the altar, he did not merely do it as a work that was required of him, but with the
            faith that in Isaac his seed would be as numberless as the stars of heaven, believing that God could raise
            him from the dead (Cyril of Alexandria, Oecumenius). It was by Abraham's perfect accomplishment of God's
            command that the active faith that he had in his heart was shown to be perfect (Bede). His deeds were
            perfected by his faith (Cyril of Jerusalem). Although orthodox belief is the foundation of our common
            confession as Christians, it is not good enough merely to mouth the words of a creed or pronounce blessings.
            Christians must back up what they say with what they do. Otherwise their words will be disregarded and
            condemned for the hypocrites that they so obviously are.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Abraham gives us a good example, since his faith led him to be willing to sacrifice
            his son Isaac. Rahab is even more remarkable. As a Gentile and a harlot, she did not have either the right
            theology or a respectable lifestyle, but God spared her because when the test came, she did the right thing.
            Rahab was justified by her faith because she performed works of mercy and showed hospitality to God's people
            (Bede). Faith saves and then lives by doing its own works (Didymus). Christians must therefore be both
            inspired and warned by these examples; inspired, because we possess so much more knowledge of the truth than
            either Abraham or Rahab possessed and can therefore do so much more than they did, but also warned, because
            if we fail to do even as much as they did, we shall be punished all the more severely for having rejected
            the knowledge that we have been given (Bede).</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Persistent Evil.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Augustine: In order to help them, God
            has put fear in the hearts of believers, lest they think that they might be saved by faith alone, even if
            they continue to practice these evils. On Continence 14.13.</span><span class="c0 c4">1</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Show Faith by Deeds.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas: If someone does not show
            by his deeds that he believes in God, his profession of faith is worthless. For it is not the one who just
            says that he is the Lord's who is a believer, but the one who loves the Lord so much that he is prepared to
            risk even death because of his faith in him. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">2</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Faith Elicits Action.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius: Take note of what
            spiritual understanding really is. It is not enough to believe in a purely intellectual sense. There has to
            be some practical application for this belief. What James is saying here does not contradict the apostle
            Paul, who understood that both belief and action were a part of what he called &ldquo;faith.&rdquo;

            words of faith, spoken to those who know that there is only one God, who is the Father of all his children.
            True love has two sides to it&mdash;help for the body and help for the soul. Here James concentrates on the
            first of these because he is speaking especially to those who are rich. Introductory Tractate on the Letter

            does not matter whether they live evil lives or do wicked and terrible things, as long as they believe in
            Christ, because salvation is through faith, have made a great mistake. James here expounds how Paul's words
            ought to be understood. This is why he uses the example of Abraham, whom Paul also used as an example of
            faith, to show that the patriarch also performed good works in the light of his faith. It is therefore wrong
            to interpret Paul in such a way as to suggest that it did not matter whether Abraham put his faith into
            practice or not. What Paul meant was that no one obtains the gift of justification on the basis of merit
            derived from works performed beforehand, because the gift of justification comes only from faith. Concerning

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">What Abraham Took on the Mount of Sacrifice.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hilary of
            Arles: When Abraham went up the mountain to sacrifice Isaac, he took four things with him&mdash;a sword,
            fire, a heavy heart and a pile of wood. What does the fire stand for if not the suffering of Christ? What
            does the sword signify, if not death? What does the wood indicate, if not the cross? And what is the
            importance of Abraham's heavy heart, if it does not stand for the compassion of the Father and the angels as
            they beheld the death of Christ? Isaac was an earthly type of Christ and was offered up for us all.
            According to tradition this occurred on 25 March, the day on which the world was created, the day on which
            the last judgment will occur. The place where it happened was none other than the one which God would later
            choose for the site of his temple on Mount Zion, which is so called because Zion means &ldquo;mirror of
            life,&rdquo; for it was there that Abraham saw as in a mirror the life which was to be revealed in the New
            Testament. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.</span><span class="c0 c4">29</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Abraham's Believing and Doing.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: James makes deft
            use of the example of Abraham in order to provoke those Jews who imagined that they were worthy followers of
            their great ancestor. In order to show them that they did not come up to the mark in times of trial and to
            test their faith by specific examples, James takes Abraham as his model. For what greater trial could there
            be than to demand that a man sacrifice his beloved son and heir? How much more would Abraham have preferred
            to give all the food and clothing he possessed to the poor than to be forced to make this supreme sacrifice
            at God's command? James is merely echoing what it says in Hebrews: &ldquo;By faith Abraham, when he was
            tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son, of whom
            it was said, &lsquo;Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.'&nbsp;&rdquo;</span><span
            class="c0 c4">30</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Looking at one and the same sacrifice, James praised the
            magnificence of Abraham's work, while Paul praised the constancy of his faith. But in reality the two men
            are saying exactly the same thing, because they both knew that Abraham was perfect in his faith as well as
            in his works, and each one merely emphasized that aspect of the incident which his own audience was most in
            need of hearing. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">31</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Distinguishing Pre- and Postbaptismal Faith.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas:
            Now someone might object to this and say: &ldquo;Did Paul not use Abraham as an example of someone who was
            justified by faith, without works? And here James is using the very same Abraham as an example of someone
            who was justified, not by faith alone, but also by works which confirm that faith.&rdquo; How can we answer
            this? And how can Abraham be an example of faith without works, as well as of faith with works, at the same
            time? But the solution is ready to hand from the Scriptures. For the same Abraham is at different times an
            example of both kinds of faith. The first is prebaptismal faith, which does not require works but only
            confession and the word of salvation, by which those who believe in Christ are justified. The second is
            postbaptismal faith, which is combined with works. Understood in this way, the two apostles do not
            contradict one another, but one and the same Spirit is speaking through both of them. Catena.</span><span

            but on the other hand Paul says that he was justified by faith, which appears to be contradictory. However,
            this is to be understood as meaning that Abraham believed before he had Isaac and that Isaac was given to
            him as a reward for his faith. Likewise, when he bound Isaac to the altar, he did not merely do the work
            which was required of him, but he did it with the faith that in Isaac his seed would be as numberless as the
            stars of heaven, believing that God could raise him from the dead.</span><span class="c0 c4">33</span><span

            looks through the Scriptures and refers to the case of Rahab, a wicked woman and a foreigner to boot, who
            nevertheless was justified by her faith because she performed works of mercy and showed hospitality to

            just as a dead man is not really a human being. But how can some say that because the spirit which gives
            life to the body is more honorable than the body, therefore works are more honorable than faith? I have
            looked into this matter in some detail and shall try to explain my position on this. It is undoubtedly true
            that the spirit is nobler than the body, but this does not mean that works can be put before faith, because
            a person is saved by grace, not by works but by faith. There should be no doubt but that faith saves and
            then lives by doing its own works, so that the works which are added to salvation by faith are not those of
            the law but a different kind of thing altogether. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">49</span>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">3:1&ndash;12 CONTROLLING THE TONGUE</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Nothing can destroy a fellowship more quickly
            than verbal abuse and gossip. The tongue is the most powerful weapon that we have, both for good and for
            evil. It is a matter for wonder that such a small part of the body can do such great things. It can preach
            the Word of God, win nations for Christ and glorify the name of our Creator. But it can also destroy
            character, divide churches and kill the soul. Human beings have learned to tame horses and ships, but their
            own tongues are another matter. Yet the tongue only reflects what is going on in the heart and soul of the
            person who is speaking, and it is this fact that is the real danger. For if a person claims to be a believer
            but then says things that contradict that claim, the truth is that he or she is not a Christian. No one is
            perfect, and we must be ready to make allowances for the failings of others rather than criticize them.
            Moreover, teachers will be judged by a higher standard, and therefore they must take special care not to
            fall into the trap of verbal abuse.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Christ chose only twelve teachers, and some of them did not come through (Hilary of
            Arles). The deeds of teachers must correspond with their words (Chrysostom, Oecumenius). Some are too eager
            to teach, so as to lead to false teaching (Isho&lsquo;dad, Bede). James singles out the tongue as a special
            instrument for either great good or great evil (Didymus, Jerome, Bede). No one is free from sins of the
            tongue (Augustine, Oecumenius). Yet the saints seek to allay God's judgment on their speech (Severus, Cyril
            of Alexandria) and pray for the healing of their speech (Pachomius). We may be imperfect, but we can still
            seek to avoid deception, cursing, pride, boasting, quarreling, lying and perjury (Bede). Sins of the tongue
            are many (Basil). So put brakes on the mouth (Augustine, Bede). The tongue is like a fire (Hilary of Arles)
            that can destroy a whole forest of good works just by saying evil things (Bede). The tongue can infect like
            gangrene (Pachomius, Oecumenius). The metaphor of the horse with bit in mouth (Chrysostom) is complemented
            by that of the ruddered ship (Andreas, Oecumenius): the great ship of life is blown by strong winds of
            passion yet directed by a small rudder&mdash;the intention of the heart (Bede). Taming the tongue is harder
            than taming a wild beast (Augustine, Andreas). Like a sword, the tongue is capable of wounding (Chrysostom,
            Hesychius). It is not made for cursing (Andreas). If mixed, the bitter water overcomes the sweet water
            (Bede). Yet the bad tongue can be converted, as in the case of Paul (Andreas).</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Underlying Text.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: James indicates that judgment

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overeagerness to Teach.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: In the days of the
            apostles there were many who were eager to go out preaching the Word of God but who lacked proper
            instruction. One of them was Apollos, who preached Christ perfectly well but who for some reason knew only
            the baptism of John. But because he was a wise person, it was not long before a teacher appeared and led him
            into greater truth, which he readily accepted and thus became even better at his preaching task. There were
            others who were much less skilled who went to Antioch from Judea and told people there that they had to be
            circumcised according to the law of Moses if they wanted to be saved, a message which gave orthodox
            preachers no little trouble. It is this second kind of teacher that James wants to remove from office, so
            that they will not be a hindrance to those who are trying to preach the gospel in the right way. For just as
            someone who serves well obtains a good report, so someone who tries to usurp the right to teach when he is
            not prepared to do so deserves greater punishment than the one he would have received if he had kept his
            wickedness to himself. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">6</span></p>

            James chose this example because somebody asked him why it was so difficult to contain something as small as
            the tongue. The text also implies that we should go on from merely controlling our tongues and find a higher
            use for them. For just as a domesticated horse is then used for better purposes, as is a ship under control,

            so, but instead he was determined to show what a great evil a man's tongue can be, so great that it cannot
            be tamed by anyone, even though that is not true of wild beasts. He said this not in order that we should

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;James picks up the theme of wisdom from the
            first chapter and discusses it in greater detail here. True wisdom is a gift of God, and therefore it
            reflects his character. By your humble and wise actions show who you are (Bede). People who boast or who
            display signs of jealousy and selfishness do not have God's wisdom but a false imitation that comes from the
            world, the flesh and the devil. This false wisdom is a lie that leads to every kind of evil practice, and
            Christians must do their utmost to avoid it. God's wisdom has many important features, but it is most
            noticeable when it brings peace within and among believers. Bitterness and jealousy are demonically
            conceived (Cassiodorus) and taint everything they touch (Bede). As long as the soul seeks earthly glory, it
            is deprived of spiritual grace (Bede). As filth blinds, so does ambition (Chrysostom). Gracious wisdom, born
            of pure thoughts (Bede), comes from above, not from our power (Augustine). Having labored in this world,
            rejoice in the harvest of righteousness in the world to come (Origen). Those who desire peace sow the earth
            with the best seed and by their daily actions gain an increase that entitles them to inherit the fruits of
            righteousness in eternal life (Bede).</span></p>

            has imposed silence on unworthy teachers and on those who want to obtain a teaching post without having the
            right qualifications of right living and circumspect behavior, so he also exhorts those who are wise and
            self-disciplined, or who at least think they are such, to demonstrate that fact by living out what they
            profess more than by trying to teach others. For someone who lives in a humble and wise way will give more
            evidence of his standing before God than any number of words could ever do. Concerning the Epistle of St.

            reap what they sow, because they will also receive their just reward at the judgment. But that reward will

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">4:1&ndash;10 EFFECTIVE PRAYER</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with wanting to enjoy
            God's creation, but everything depends on recognizing what those good things are and seeking them in the
            right way. Do not become fixated on making comparisons between what you own and what your neighbor owns
            (Dionysius of Alexandria). This intensifies the struggle within (Bede). When someone desires something
            inordinately, it tends to ensure the receiving of the opposite (Oecumenius). God will see to it that
            petitions arising from bad motives will not be fulfilled (Augustine, Andreas). So pray for right motives
            (Bede). The godly petitioner asks only for what is compatible with the divine promises (Didymus), for what
            pleases God and for what God will freely give (Pseudo-Dionysius). There can be no enduring coexistence of
            virtue with evil (Origen, Didymus), and so it has been since the fallen angels and Adam (Hilary of Arles).
            Our enmities tend to make us morally blind (Oecumenius, Symeon). So make the proper use of wisdom
            (Oecumenius).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">God yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us. This is so
            whether it refers to God's Spirit or the spirit in us that draws us toward God (Severian, Bede). Beware of
            self-conceit (Jerome, Augustine). Draw near to gracious people (Clement of Rome). God wants to dwell in you
            (Caesarius of Arles), but this indwelling can occur only in a humble, merciful heart (Macarius of Egypt,
            Valerian). God resists the proud who trust in their own strength but gives grace to the humble because they
            recognize their need and ask him for help (Didymus, Hesychius, Bede, Oecumenius). God dwells in us (Ambrose)
            that he might destroy the death that has come upon us and give us more grace (Andreas).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile we must fight against demonic captivity (Caesarius of Arles), a struggle in
            which one cannot be double-minded (Oecumenius). Those who remain unashamed of their sin are miserable, not
            so much because they have fallen from grace but because they have remained in their fallen state
            (Chrysostom). Mourn your sins (Leander). Be ready to repent while there is time (Bede). The most important
            blessings that we can ever receive are spiritual ones, and Christians must be sufficiently detached from the
            cares of this world that they can recognize this and pray for that kind of blessing. There is no room here
            for compromise. To embrace the world is to reject God. By </span><span class="c0 c3">world</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;James means the desires of ungodly people, who are at war with the Spirit of God. The only
            way to deal with this effectively is to humble ourselves and turn back to God in prayer and supplication. If
            we do this, we shall be full of contrition, and our prayers will be punctured by weeping rather than by
            laughter. Only if we come to God as abject penitents will he be willing to help us, but when we have that
            attitude, then we shall discover that far from rejecting us, he lifts us up and receives us with great joy
            and gladness into his heavenly kingdom.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Struggle Within.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Your passions are at war in
            your members whenever your hands or your tongue or some combination of your bodily parts obeys the
            promptings of your depraved mind. It is also possible that the passions mentioned here are in fact good
            desires, pointing towards the riches and benefits of God's kingdom. On account of these and many other such
            things there is often a struggle between good and evil going on in our minds. Concerning the Epistle of St.
            James.</span><span class="c0 c4">4</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ask for Right Motives.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: The reason that you
            struggle but fail to obtain what you want is that you do not ask God to give these things to you. For if you
            ask him with the right motives, he will give you not only everything you need here on earth but also what
            you need to get to heaven. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span class="c0 c4">5</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Opposite Obtained from Wrong Desires.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Oecumenius:
            James proceeds here by way of thesis and antithesis. The thesis, that is, what they desire, is absurd to
            begin with, but the way they go about getting what they want ensures the exact opposite. Murder and fighting
            are not good things, but neither do the good things which they desire follow from them. Note also that here
            James speaks of murder and of fighting as spiritual things, not physical ones. It would be bad enough to
            think this kind of thing about robbers, but how much worse it is when we are dealing with people who have a
            certain amount of faith and who have turned to God. These are people who are trying to kill the soul and to
            fight against godliness. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">6</span></p>

            class="c0 c4">7</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;How can it be then that some people pray but do not get what
            they ask for? To this it must be answered that if someone comes to prayer in the right way, omitting none of
            the prerequisites for intercession, he will receive everything he asks for. But if someone appears to be
            going beyond the permissible bounds laid down for intercession, he will appear to be asking for something in
            the wrong way and therefore will not obtain it. Commentary on James.</span><span class="c0 c4">8</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">God Grasps Our Worthiness to Receive.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Andreas: It
            appears that some ask but do not receive. God ignores those who attack him and those who ask wrongly,
            according to their own desires. But someone will say that even those who ask for divine wisdom and virtue do
            not receive them. In reply it must be said that such people may be worthy to receive these good things, but
            they must do so in the right way. Perhaps they want such things merely for the pleasure of having them, and
            if so, they will not get them. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">10</span></p>

            is compatible with the divine promises, for what pleases God and for what God will freely give. He thereby
            demonstrates to God the lover of good that his own conduct is always modeled on the Good and shows those who
            are present what kinds of gifts the saints will receive. On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy 7.3.7.</span><span

            so much because he fell from grace but because he has remained in his fallen state. And if it is a wicked
            thing not to repent after sinning, what punishment will someone deserve who sins as a matter of course? If a

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Humble persons understand that they are in no
            position to pass judgment on others, and they will not do so. On the contrary, they recognize that they are
            also under judgment and will be more concerned to put their own lives right than to go about criticizing
            others. Christians must also watch how they plan their lives. It is all too easy to map out a future in
            which God has no place, but we must remember that everything we do is bound by the limits of time and of his
            will. To forget this is to fall back into the sin of pride, which can only lead to our destruction. Many
            would prefer to mind the business of others more than their own (Cyril of Alexandria). Such pride ultimately
            arises from contempt of others (Oecumenius). Our knowing complicates our sinning (Augustine). The faith
            rightly proclaimed must first be lived (Oecumenius). There is only one law and one lawgiver (Hilary of
            Arles, Bede, Theophylact). View your life in terms of the wider perspective of God's grace (Cyril of
            Alexandria, Oecumenius). James is aware of how fleeting and empty our present life is (Augustine,

            but prefer to mind the business of others. If they happen to see others suffering, it seems that they forget
            their own weaknesses and set about criticizing them and slandering them. They condemn them, not knowing that
            they suffer from the same things as the people they have criticized, and in so doing they condemn
            themselves. The wise Paul writes exactly the same thing: &ldquo;If you judge another in something, you
            condemn yourself, for the one who judges does the same things.&rdquo;</span><span

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Once again James picks up a theme that he has
            already dealt with: the question of human riches. People with a lot of money should consider what it is that
            they have&mdash;a wasting resource that they cannot take with them when they die and that even now is in a
            state of constant decay. The love of money is the root of all evil and will lead people to defraud and even
            kill those who are less fortunate than they are. The rich must repent while there is still time (Hilary of
            Arles), casting their bread upon waters (Oecumenius). God's love is delaying judgment to give them time for
            repentance (Hesychius). Perishable riches (Bede) can neither hurt a good person or help a bad person
            (Caesarius of Arles). Luxury comes to nothing (Chrysostom). God's power ultimately puts to right all human
            injustices (Hilary of Arles, Bede, Theophylact). Pray for a soul set free from excess (Chrysostom). It is
            time to give generously where we have given only sparingly (Caesarius of Arles). Human injustices are viewed

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The return of Christ was a constant hope in
            the early church, where there was a strong conviction that they were living in the last days before the end.
            To those who were suffering, the wait seemed interminable, but it was important to develop a proper sense of
            perspective. The example of the patience of Job and the Old Testament prophets was held out to Christians as
            proof that what they were hoping for would eventually come and that when it finally arrived the wait would
            seem like no time at all. Although God now waits for our repentance (Cyril of Alexandria), he may come
            quickly at any time to dispense justice (Bede). As in the case of Job, the devil is allowed to put us on
            trial, not merely in order to take our possessions away but that when that happens he can force us to curse
            God because of it (Chrysostom). Our hope is for eternal, not temporal, rewards (Augustine, Bede).</span></p>

            took forty years to lead his people out of slavery and into the promised land. Concerning the Epistle of St.

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">5:12&ndash;20 SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overview:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;James closes his letter with a brief sketch of
            how we should conduct our relationship with God. First of all, it is important to avoid demeaning God's
            name, which points to his power and presence in the world. Let the witness of your life be stronger than any
            oath (Cyril of Alexandria). An oath adds nothing to a simple yes or no (Chrysostom) and tends toward
            disaster as seen in the case of Herod (Bede). We must not give the creation more value than it has by
            deifying it (Cyril of Alexandria). The need of an oath comes from an unsure conscience (Leander). Pray and
            praise God whether in good times or bad (Andreas, Bede).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">In time of suffering and illness we must turn to God, and if our sins are too great
            for us to deal with on our own, we must call the elders of the church to come and assist us. The apostolic
            tradition calls for the elders to anoint the sick with the oil of mercy and pray for their healing (Hilary
            of Arles, Bede, Oecumenius). The prayer of faith is efficacious (Caesarius of Arles) when it gives
            expression to the petition of the whole consenting church (Hilary of Arles). Do not leave sin unconfessed
            and ignored either in your own house or another's (Augustine). And do not bore others with every detail
            (Braulio of Saragossa). The Lord himself who had no sin sets the example for sinners to pray for our sins
            (Augustine). Prayers of the righteous are beneficial (Pseudo-Dionysius), especially when one does works
            fitting to the prayer (Maximus the Confessor). God loves to be asked (Bede). The effectiveness of prayer
            offered by the right people in the right way can never be underestimated, as the case of Elijah reminds us.
            We are called to persevere in prayer like Elijah (Hilary of Arles), who was on fire with zeal for God
            (Chrysostom, Theodoret).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The most important thing of all is to recover the lost sheep who have gone astray,
            and those who do this will give incontrovertible proof of the fact that they are ready to reign with Christ
            in his eternal kingdom. One who converts others will save his own soul (Origen, Hilary of Arles). Out of
            love (Bede) the shepherd of souls rescues and delivers souls from death (Gregory the Great, Symeon). Unless
            we protect what has been sown in us by constant care, the devil will snatch it away (Chrysostom).</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">5:12a </span><span class="c1 c3">Do Not Swear</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">An Oath Adds Nothing.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Chrysostom: What if someone swears
            an oath and claims that he was forced to do so? The fear of God is more powerful than any force. For though
            you may start out by swearing all kinds of promises, you will not keep any of them. Moreover, you would not
            dare to swear or give an oath in matters of human law, which you accept whether you want to or not. You
            would certainly never claim that you were forced into doing so. Now the person who has heard the blessings
            of God and who has prepared himself as Christ has commanded will never claim any need to do anything of the
            kind, for he is respected and honored by all. What is needed beyond a simple yes and no? An oath adds
            nothing to these, for no one has to be told that evil is the source of both excess and its deficient
            opposite. An oath is a form of excess. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">1</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Do Not Deify Creation.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Cyril of Alexandria: Let the
            witness of our life be stronger than an oath, and if some shameless person dares to ask an oath from you,
            let your yes be yes and your no be no, instead of swearing an oath. James forbids us to swear by heaven or
            by earth for this reason, that we should not give the creation more value than it has by deifying it. For
            those who swear, swear by something greater than themselves, as the apostle says.</span><span

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Herod's Oath Recalled.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: This is the judgment to
            which Herod fell victim, so that he found that he had either to break his oath or commit another shameful
            act in order to avoid breaking it. Homilies on the Gospels 2.23.</span><span class="c0 c4">4</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Unsure Conscience.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Leander: Jesus said: &ldquo;Let
            your yes be yes and your no, no.&rdquo; Any more than this is evil. So do not swear for good reason, because
            that is evil. It is said to be evil because the need of an oath comes from an unsure conscience. It is
            necessary to extract an oath from one whose sincerity is in doubt, but why should you bind yourself by an
            involuntary oath when you are bound to show with your lips the sincerity of your heart? Speak the truth from
            your heart and you will not need an oath. The Training of Nuns 29 (19).</span><span class="c0 c4">5</span>

            complain to each other about their sufferings, so now he goes on to say how they should behave. If someone
            has suffered an injury, he ought to go to the church and pray that God will send him the grace of his
            comfort, so that the sadness of this world, which leads to death, will not overtake him. Concerning the

            sickness of sin. If someone is struck down by his own thoughts, then he should pray on his own, but if he
            has committed some sin he should ask for the church's prayers. The custom mentioned here is followed even
            today, for the grace of mercy is symbolized by oil. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of
            James.</span><span class="c0 c4">8</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Pray for the Sick.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bede: Just as he has already advised
            the person who has been injured, so now James gives his advice to the one who is ill. In order to prevent
            the foolishness of complaining, he told the injured person to pray and sing, and now he tells the person who
            is sick, either in body or in faith, to call the elders in proportion to the gravity of the illness which he
            is enduring. James does not advise this person to call the younger members of the church because they are
            less experienced in such matters and run the risk of saying or doing something which will make matters
            worse. We read in the New Testament that the apostles did this sort of thing, and the custom is retained in
            the church, that the priests will anoint a person who is ill and pray for his healing. And this is not the
            prerogative of the priests only, for in cases of necessity any Christian may do this, provided that he uses
            only oil which has been consecrated by the bishop. And of course anyone who anoints a sick person in this
            way must invoke the name of God over him while doing so. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.</span><span

            serious way, then we ought to follow the principle of showing our leprosy to the priest and do penance for

            how much more ought we to pray for each other's sins! And if he for whom we have nothing to forgive forgives

            Confessor: There are two ways in which the prayer of a righteous man is effective. The first is when the
            person praying does so by offering to God his works done according to his commands. Then the prayer is not
            just a matter of words, blurted out meaninglessly with the empty echo of the tongue, but powerful and living
            and inspired with the spirit of the commandments. For the true basis of prayer and supplication is the
            fulfillment of the commandments by virtue. This makes the prayer of a righteous person strong and full of
            power. The second way is when the person who asks for the prayers of a righteous man fulfills the works of
            prayer, above all by putting his life right. Then he makes the prayer of the righteous man strong, because
            it is reinforced by his own wonderful conversion. For there is nothing to be profited by a person who makes
            use of the prayer of a righteous man if he is himself already more inclined to virtue than to vice.

    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">How to Convert Others.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Chrysostom: And how do you go
            about converting someone? It is like the seeds sown by farmers. They are sown once, but they do not survive
            forever unless they are carefully nurtured. And unless the tillers of the soil protect the seeds, they will
            be exposed to the birds and to every seed-eating creature. We are just like this, unless we protect what has
            been sown in us by constant care, for the devil will snatch it away and our own lethargy will destroy it.
            The sun dries it up, the rain drowns it, and weeds choke it, so that it is not enough for the sower to pass
            by once only. Rather he must tend it often, driving away the birds of the air, pulling up the weeds and
            filling up the rocky places with much soil. He must prevent, block off and eject any form of destruction.
            Where soil is concerned, everything depends on the farmer, for without him it remains lifeless, ready only
            to suffer harm. It is not like that with spiritual soil however. For in spiritual matters it is not all up
            to the teachers; at least half the effort must come from the pupils. It is up to us the teachers to sow the
            seed but up to you the pupils to do the rest. Catena.</span><span class="c0 c4">31</span></p>

            a great thing to rescue someone's body when it is on the point of death, how much greater is it to deliver
            someone's soul from death, so that it might live forever in the heavenly country? Lessons in Job
